/**
 * Repo-wide invariant: every exported validator refuses a hostile own key,
 * and refuses it by FAILING rather than by throwing.
 *
 * This check exists because of a defect class that appeared three separate
 * times in this repository, each time in a different file, each time fixed by
 * name without anyone going looking for its siblings:
 *
 *   mayIssue("toString", ...)                  threw (PERMITTED[role] found
 *                                              Object.prototype.toString)
 *   validateRemoteDecisionState({kind:"toString"})  threw ("in" walks the chain)
 *   statusIsSupportedBy([Object.create({status:"supported"})])  returned TRUE
 *
 * The last one manufactured an unearned pass. Fixing instances one at a time
 * is how the third survived the first two fixes, so the property is asserted
 * here across every validator at once, including validators not yet written.
 *
 * `__proto__` is the probe because JSON.parse creates it as a genuine OWN
 * property, so it crosses a serialization boundary intact and reaches a
 * validator looking exactly like ordinary data.

/**
 * Hostile shapes, one per way a validator reaches for a key.
 *
 * A single `__proto__` probe is NOT enough, and finding that out is why this
 * list exists: every validator rejects an unknown top-level field anyway, so a
 * `__proto__`-only probe passes even with the forbidden-key guard disabled. It
 * confirms unknown-field handling and calls it prototype safety.
 *
 * The defects this check is meant to catch lived at DISCRIMINATOR lookups —
 * `KEYS[kind]`, `PERMITTED[role]` — which are only reached once the
 * discriminator is present and string-typed. So the probes below carry
 * inherited property names in the discriminator position, where an ordinary
 * object lookup finds Object.prototype's member instead of undefined.
